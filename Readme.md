# MDesign - React Frontend

Single page application build with React for interacting with a REST API (built with Java Spring).

## Use case

MDesign is a Fablab based in Metz (France) which organizes events for makers, schools and public institutions.

Every year a report containing information about all these events has to be provided to official institution
(state, region etc.).
To speed up the storage, retrieval and analysis of this data, I was tasked to develop an application,
which will help with these tasks.

## Features

Planned features:
* Adding, Editing and Deleting Events with relevant information (e.g. name, location, start and end times etc.)
* Saving attendees information (e.g. name, age, gender)
* Querying the data with multiple parameters
* Generating a CSV file with the query result
* Authentication using JWT between the React Frontend and the Spring Backend.

## Built With

* [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/)
* [React-Router](https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-java)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) â€“ React Wrapper for Bootstrap
